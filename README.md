## Introduction 📖

The Advanced Speech Transcription App aims for precise yet fast speech recognition using multiple threads for each phrase recorded.

It uses Whisper models **locally**.

## Key Features 💫

- **State-of-the-Art Transcription**: Utilizes OpenAI's Whisper models to deliver exceptionally accurate transcriptions.
- **Real-Time Recognition**: Immediate transcription with real-time voice processing capabilities.
- **Adaptive Noise Reduction**: Reduces background noise and enhances speech clarity.
- **Multi-Threaded Background Processing**: Splits speech recognition into as many threads as needed depending on the speaker's type of speech.
- **Custom Stop Commands**: Easily terminate transcription sessions with user-defined phrases.
- **Persistent Output**: Automatically saves the transcribed text to your chosen destination.

## Getting Started 🌱

### Prerequisites 📋

Before installing the Advanced Speech Transcription App, you'll need:
- **Python 3.9** or above
- **Pip package manager** (usually included with Python)
- **Microphone** (duh 😂)

### Installation 📥

```bash
# Clone the project repository
git clone https://github.com/AlexYelisieiev/advanced-speech-transcription.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd advanced-speech-transcription-app

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
venv/bin/activate

# Install all dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Launch the application
python main.py
```

> [!NOTE]
> Once launched for the first time, it will install the Whisper model to use locally.

## How to Use 💻

Initiate the app and expose it to the speech source once it says "Listening:" (until then, it's adjusting the microphone to the environment). The real-time transcription will appear on your screen. To end the transcription, simply utter a predefined stop phrase, and the session will conclude, saving the transcription to the designated file.

## Customization 🔧

Personalize your experience by editing the `SpeechRecognizer` class parameters:
- `whisper_model`: Select from [various Whisper model options](https://github.com/openai/whisper#available-models-and-languages) to match your transcription accuracy needs.
- `output_file_path`: Designate your desired file path for storing transcripts.
- `STOP_PHRASES`: Customize the stop phrases for an intuitive way to end transcription sessions.
